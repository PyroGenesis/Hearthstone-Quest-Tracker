Hearthstone Quest Tracker
========================
This is a plugin for [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker)

Hearthstone has a lot of daily play quests, many of which warrant their own decks. However, there is no way to know the progress of these quests while playing a match.

This plugin attempts to solve this problem by allowing you to set and keep track of progress in your daily quests by tracking played cards.
  
  
## Features

I will try to make/keep this plugin functional to the best of my ability. I am very new to C# development so any improvements or suggestions are welcome.
